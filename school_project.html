    <div class="content">
        <h1>Goal</h1>
        <p>Make a 3D software ray casting renderer.</p>
        <h1>Why</h1>
        <p>Iâ€™ve been doing a lot
            of graphics programming recently and wanted to do something with
            lighting.</p>
        <h1>How</h1>
        <h3>Theory:</h3>
        <p>Ray casting is
            when you shoot a ray, and check if it intersects something. To
            render things using this technique, you can shoot rays for
            every pixel, and check if it intersects an object.
            Depending on the color (and other properties) of what it
            hit you change the corresponding pixel's color. Ray tracing is
            this concept but extended, where you also trace things like
            reflection and refraction to produce more photo-realistic
            renders.</p>

        <p>So far the code is only a simple ray caster for colored spheres
            due to project time limit.

        <h3>Reflection:</h1>
            <p>I enjoyed this project as it's similar to what I do when program
                at home. The less structured approach allowed me to learn the
                information I needed fast and move one.</p>
