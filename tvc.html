  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>While browsing YouTube one day, I came across a channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BPSspace">BPS.Space</a>.</p>
  <p>At the time (the channel does many rocket-things now), it was about building model rockets which could stabalize themselves using Thrust Vector Control (TVC).</p>
  <p>Thrust Vectoring is when a vehicle (like a rocket or plane) manipulates the direction of its thrust to change its direction and angular velocity. </p>

  <img src="images/rocketry/tvc/introductiontvcplanes.jpg" alt="tvc planes">
  <figcaption>Planes which use thrust vectoring on their engines.</figcaption>
  <p>
    The channel inspired me to build my own TVC rocket. I always liked space-related things, like rocketry, as well as engineering and software development. 
    Building a rocket like this would include aspects of all of these, from PCB and engine mount design to writing stabalization software, so it seemed like 
    the perfect project. This page is a documentation of my progress on this project, and will be updated periodically.
