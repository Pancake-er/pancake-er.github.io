        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>While browsing YouTube one day, I came across a channel called <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BPSspace">BPS.Space</a>.</p>
        <p>At the time (the channel does many rocket-things now), it was about building model rockets which could
            stabalize themselves using Thrust Vector Control (TVC).</p>
        <p>Thrust Vectoring is when a vehicle (like a rocket or plane) manipulates the direction of its thrust to change
            its direction and angular velocity. </p>

        <img src="images/rocketry/tvc/introductiontvcplanes.jpg" alt="TVC Planes" width="50%">
        <figcaption>Planes which use thrust vectoring on their engines.</figcaption>
        <p>The channel inspired me to build my own TVC rocket. This page is a documentation of my progress, as well as why
            and how I do things on this project. I will update it periodically.

        <h1>Engine Mount Design</h1>
        <h2>(February 4th, 2023)</h2>

        <p>As of now, I nearly have a fully finished (prototype) version of an engine mount. 
            The servos are not yet connected, and part of the arm is broken. I hope to finish and test it soon.
        </p>
        <img src="images/rocketry/tvc/mount_assembled.jpg" alt="Mount Prototype" width="50%">
        <p>Every 3D printed part of this rocket has so far been designed in Tinkercad. 
            Though maybe not the most professional option, it does everything I need it to do efficiently, conviently, and for free.
            All the parts are printed on my Creality Ender 3 Pro:
        </p>
        <img src="images/rocketry/tvc/ender3.jpg" alt="Creality Ender 3 Pro" width="50%">
        <p>The first verion of the main ring looked like this:</p>
        <img src="images/rocketry/tvc/mount_first.png" alt="Very First Mount Model" width="50%">
        <p>At the time, I had not used much CAD, so it was very rough.
            After printing it I quickly realised I couldn't even screw in the servo screws.
            After few variations of just the ring, I "got distracted" by other projects.
            But through those, like from this fully automatic rubber band gun with removable magazines:
        </p>
        <img src="images/rocketry/tvc/rubber_band_gun.png" alt="Rubber Band Gun Model" width="50%">
        <p>I gained a lot of design experience. After finding a datasheet with the servo dimensions,
            I was able to design this version fairly quick and without much trouble, despite the unsual round space constraints of the rocket body:
        </p>
        <img src="images/rocketry/tvc/finished_mount_design.png" alt="Finished Mount Design" width="50%">
        <figcaption>The green arm is acutally not its first iteration. It used to be mounted on only one side, which would bend under pressure.</figcaption>
        <img src="images/rocketry/tvc/bodytube.jpg" alt="Body Tube" width="50%">
        <figcaption>A lightweight 77mm paper tube that will be the body of the rocket.
            Because it's round, it is critical to consider how everything will move once inside. 
            For example, the mount can rotate a lot outside of it, but only a few degrees inside. I had to design around this.
        </figcaption>
        <p>The small darker brown ring in the center will hold the 29mm motor (the tan cylinder). 
            The servo on the arm will be connected with a rod to this. The motor can either be glued into the ring,
            friction fitted by increasing its radius with electrical tape, compressed by further tightening the screws holding the ring,
            or a combination of these methods. The ring is small so it can simply be thrown away (if the motor is glued in) and reprinted quickly.
        </p>
        <p>The plastic parts will be connected to the servos using stiff bent metal wire I have laying around.</p>
        <img src="images/rocketry/tvc/servo.png" alt="Rubber Band Gun Model" width="50%">
        <figcaption>One of the cheap SG92R micro-servos that will move the gimbal. 
            I have read of people having issues with the accuracy of these, so I may need to use higher quality ones in the future.
        </figcaption>
        <p>Unfortunatley, my printer was not cooperating, and it would take many attempts to print everything. 
            Eventally (after much trouble shooting, changing the bowden tube, and fixing other under extrusion issues) 
            I had everything printed, except for the green arm. Not only would this part fail multiple times half way through,
            but I kept breaking it while taking off supports. 
        </p>
        <img src="images/rocketry/tvc/mount_broken1.jpg" alt="Broken Mount" width="50%">
        <figcaption>One of the mounts I broke taking the supports off.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Just some of the failed arms.</figcaption>
        <p>
            After some trial and error, I eventually got an intact one,
            but ignorantly overtightend one of the screws, and tore through the plastic.
        </p>
        <img src="images/rocketry/tvc/mount_broken4.jpg" alt="Overtightend Arm" width="50%">
        <figcaption>The one I overtightend the screw in.</figcaption>
        <img src="images/rocketry/tvc/connection_mechanism.jpg" alt="Part Connection Mechanism" width="50%"> 
        <figcaption>Part connection mechanism. A nut is inserted into a slot (that is not the full depth of the part)
            and then you essentially acheive a threaded hole which is much stronger and more precise (higher resolution) than could be 3D printed. 
            You can then screw in a screw. Not my idea, I found it on some forum a while back.
        </figcaption>
        <p>
            This is where I'm at with the mount at the moment (the overtightend arm is actually the one used in the pictures of it assembled,
            beucase it still works, just not ideally). The next step would be to reprint the arm, put the two rings and the arm together,
            and test its motion with a lit engine and my flight computer at the helm.
